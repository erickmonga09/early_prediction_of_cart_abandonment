# Early prediction of cart abandonment
This group project aims to perform early prediction of whether a user will abandon their cart in the current shopping session after adding at least one product to the cart. This is a binary classification problem, where each session is classified as either abandoned (negative class) or completed (positive class). The project involves several tasks, including preprocessing the data, implementing a baseline Na誰ve Bayes classifier, developing an experimental model, creating an oracle model, and conducting error analysis.

## Main Goal
To predict cart abandonment based on user behavior during the shopping session, focusing on clicks and actions taken by the user.

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by the organizers of the challenge. It includes user sessions with details of actions performed during each session, such as adding products to the cart, viewing product details, and making purchases.

## Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric for this project is the F1 score. Predictions are evaluated at 5, 10, and 15 clicks after the first add-to-cart event in a session.

## Methods
Given the nature of the assignment, several methods were selected and tried to enhance the prediction accuracy. The project includes a baseline Na誰ve Bayes classifier, an experimental Random Forest model, and an oracle model for upper bound performance estimation. Extensive error analysis was also conducted to improve and understand model performance.
